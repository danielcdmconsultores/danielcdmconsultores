ðŸ“¼ A Blast From the Past ðŸ“¼

Basic Beginnings: Remember when BASIC ruled the world? Revisit the golden age of programming with my early projects in this cherished language.
C-rious 80s: A tribute to the era when C was king, and I was but a young code-slinger honing my skills.
Assembler Adventures: Delve into the depths of low-level programming, where I tinkered with bits and bytes to create masterpieces.
